    <p>안녕! i'm soro <br>just a regular CS student figuring out life, one debug at a time. Part-time movie buff and occasional existential crisis haver. I'm out here trying to make my neurons and neural networks fire in sync.</p>
    <p>currently fine-tuning my skills: <br><br>
        ML (teaching robots to think for me), <br>
        Python (the snek that does math), <br>
        C/C++ (for when Python needs speed), <br>
        DS & Algos (fancy ways to organize my chaos), <br>
        OS (making computers talk to themselves), <br>
        GNN (turning graphs into more than nodes), <br>
        Quantization (shrinking models down, without losing their magic)
    </p>
