    <p>안녕! i'm soro <br>just a regular CS student figuring out life, one debug at a time. Part-time movie buff and occasional existential crisis haver. I'm out here trying to make my neurons and neural networks fire in sync.</p>

    <p>
        Currently fine-tuning my skills in: ML (teaching robots to think for me), 
        Python (the snek that does math), 
        C/C++ (for when Python needs speed), 
        DS & Algos (fancy ways to organize my chaos), 
        OS (making computers talk to themselves), 
        GNN (turning graphs into more than nodes), and 
        Quantization (shrinking models down, without losing their magic).
    </p>

        when not coding: lost in movies that make me question reality, listening to music that fuels my soul, and and enjoying the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUECWi5pX7o" target="_blank">little things</a>.
