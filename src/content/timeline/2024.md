Started working on my final year project. Realized I know nothing. But hey, that's the first step to knowing something, right?

It was a cold winter morning when I first opened my IDE. The cursor blinked at me, mocking my lack of knowledge. I typed `import torch`, and the red squiggly lines appeared instantly. Dependency hell had begun.

## The Struggle
I spent weeks just trying to get the environment set up. CUDA versions clashed with PyTorch versions, which clashed with my patience.

*   **Day 1**: Installed Python. Felt good.
*   **Day 7**: Still trying to install CUDA.
*   **Day 30**: Finally ran a "Hello World" in PyTorch.

### Visual Evidence

Here is a full width image of my "setup":

And here are two images side by side, showing the "Before" and "After" (spoiler: they look the same):

Eventually, things started to click. I built my first neural network. It didn't learn anything, but it ran without crashing. That was a victory in itself.

### What I Learned
1.  **Persistence is key**: You will fail. A lot.
2.  **Google is your friend**: StackOverflow is your best friend.
3.  **Read the docs**: Seriously, read them.

Now, looking back, I realize that those sleepless nights were the most valuable part of my education. Not because of the code I wrote, but because of the problem-solving skills I developed.
